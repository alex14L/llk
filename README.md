## What is League of Kingdom's resources?
- Like some strategy game you need a lot of resources to run your kingdom, resources are needed to train your troops and upgrade every infrastructure inside of your kingdoms, resources will serve as fuel and without it, your kingdom will not operate.
- Resources including food, lumber, stone, gold, and rare crystals.

- I use tool that find crystals. It works but there are problems. The tool only retrieves the list of resources available on the map. It doesn't show whether the resources have been mined or not.
- So I create paid version that resolve problem.
